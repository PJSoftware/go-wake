= go-wake
Peter Jones <pjsoftware@petesplace.id.au>

Provides the ability to prevent your PC from going to sleep while a long-running program is active.

== Getting started

This package can be imported into your module via:

[,sh]
----
go get github.com/pjsoftware/go-wake
----

and then:

[,go]
----
import "github.com/pjsoftware/go-wake"
----

Typical code might look like:

[,go]
----
func main() {
  wake.StayAwake()
  defer wake.AllowSleep()

  doLongRunningThing()
}
----

Under the hood, `StayAwake()` (and its companion option, `KeepScreenOn()`) sends a message to the system that detects user activity, every few minutes, telling it to reset its "inactivity" timer.
Once your program ends, this signal will no longer be sent, so forgetting to use `AllowSleep()` has no real impact -- but it is good practice to call it anyway.
